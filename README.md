# Starstruck Courier
January 30th, 2021 - Full Install ~40GB

## MODLIST SUMMARY
Starstruck Courier combines Tale of Two Wastelands with Fallout: New California, allowing one to play through Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout: New California in one continuous save file. In addition to adding New California, this list also includes new quest content for both Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, updated textures, gameplay improvements, and quality of life fixes.

## REQUIREMENTS
* Current version of [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)
* Clean, legally acquired installs of Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and all DLCs for both games. **Both games must be installed on the same disk.**
* A legally acquired copy of [Tale of Two Wastelands](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl)
* A legally acquired copy of [Fallout: New California](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45138)
* A Nexusmods account. Nexus premium is **HIGHLY** recommended for automatic downloads.
* 70GB of free space. This figure does not include Fallout 3 or New Vegas installations. It does include some extra buffer space just to be safe. 
* Once Fallout 3 and New Vegas are installed, run them both once through Steam. This will set up registry keys and allow Wabbajack to recognize them. Fallout 3 may not run - this is expected and normal.

## TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## REGARDING THE DISABLED MODS
* **50% XP Rate** - Enable this for a 50% Experience reduction. Do not enable this until after you have complete Fallout New California's prologue and slept in the bed in your dorm room. If you are not intending to play Fallout New California you can enable this from the beginning.
* **Music Pack for Radio NV - No Song Info Messages** - This list contains a radio mod that adds many new songs and new features to Radio New Vegas. One of these features is Song Title and Artist Info in the top left of your screen on each new song. If you wish to disable these messages, enable this mod.

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN PLAYING
* Fallout New California's vigor tester section is extremely prone to bugs and glitches. To minimise the chance of something going wrong, do not select any traits that alter your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. You will be given the option of redoing your character at the end of the prologue section, after sleeping in your dorm. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. altering traits can be selected at this time. 
* The mod **Tale of Two Wastelands Quick Start** will place you in the Vault 101 exit tunnel with most collectible items found in the vault. If you wish to play through the beginning of Fallout 3, simply disable this mod.
* In the exit tunnel, near the vault door is a terminal. You can use this terminal to select a starting loadout in order to prepare yourself for the adventures ahead. You will not carry this loadout with you into New California, but it will be returned to you when you complete it.
* Upon emerging from Vault 101's exit tunnel you will see a newly added bunker on your left. This contains the start area for New California. You must enter this bunker and begin New California before you hit level 3 or it will be permanently closed off to you. If you wish to skip New California and proceed straight to Fallout 3, simply ignore this bunker entirely.
* On the left panel is a mod entitled **lStewieAI's Tweaks** - this is a file loaded with options that change how the game plays and crucial engine level fixes. If you are happy with how the game plays you won't need to touch anything in this mod. Otherwise, you can look through the ini in this mod and enable or disable tweaks and quality of life changes as you see fit. 
* It is highly recommended to cap your FPS at 60. While the game is playable at higher framerates you may experience bugginess.
* **TTW IS INTENDED FOR A FALLOUT 3 START. IF YOU START IN NEW VEGAS YOU WILL BREAK THE LIST.**

## MCM SETTINGS
*  **JIP S-F**
    * General Settings - Set fire-mode switch key to whatever you prefer.
    * HUD Indicator Settings - Adjust to your preference. Option 1 displays the widget in the top right corner of the screen, while option 2 displays it close to your ammo count.
* **Enhanced Item Info**
    * Disable Always Show List Box in both GameMode and Menumode.
    * Disable Value/Weight Ratio under VATS Menu.
* **Just Mods**
    * Disable Hold Breath, Bullet Time, and Loot Menu.
* **The Weapon Mod Menu**
    * Disable All Weapon Mods Visible

## KNOWN ISSUES
* MCM settings may not save properly or may reset. To reduce the chance of this happening, wait until you have exited Vault 101 and assigned S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, traits, etc. to do the MCM settings. 
* A handful of locations in New California are very intensive and will cause frame drops. This is a known issue with the NC devs, and not something that can be fixed.
* The quest objective will sometimes repeatedly pop-up. This so far appears to be localized to New California and I am looking into how this can be fixed.
* Visible quest markers will occasionally point to seemingly empty spots of land. This is normal and will not pose any issues.
* You may see some landscape flickering. This is a consequence of using the FNVLodgen tool, and nothing can be done about this.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
* **How do I begin New California?**
* You will be given a quest on game startup entitled **The Room Where It Happens** - this is the pre-New California quest and it will guide you. To start, enter the bunker immediately to your left when you emerge from the vault exit tunnel, read the note on the table, and then activate the VR helmet.

* **What if I don't want to play New California?**
* Simply ignore the bunker entirely. Once you attain level 3 in the Capital Wasteland the bunker will be forever closed to that character.

* **I've begun New California, where's all my stuff?**
* You will have a starting loadout for New California depending on your choice (dodge or tackle) in the beginning of the game. When you have completed New California, you will be transported back to the starting bunker. There will be storage containers with your gear, including a bonus reward depending on which ending you received.

* **Help! I'm way overleveled for Fallout 3 after completing New California!**
* There is currently no way to reset your character after completing New California but before starting New Vegas, barring console commands. It is for this reason that it is highly recommended that you reduce your XP gain after completing the New California prologue. There is an included, disabled by default, mod which will cut your exp rate in half. If you wish to reduce this level further, you can edit **fXPMultiplier =** in the ini in the 50% EXP Rate mod.

* **Can I skip ahead to New Vegas?**
* No. TTW's New Vegas start is notoriously buggy and that option has been removed entirely for this list. Using console commands to teleport yourself there early can break the game, including CTDs or infinite loading screens. If you _must_ head there early, only do so after attaining level 3 in the Capital Wasteland, and after the pop-up message informing you that the bunker has been destroyed is dealt with.

* **Where's CASM?**
* CASM's functionality has been replicated in lStewieAI's Tweaks.

* **Why isn't (insert content mod here) in the list?**
* Anything that has been left out is due to it destabilizing the list or personal preference. There may be additional content mods added in the future, there may not be.

* **Can I add an ENB to this list?**
* Adding an ENB is discouraged. This list was designed without an ENB and no support will be given for adding one. 

* **What's the deal with the song titles popping up in the corner?**
* Enable the optional mod **Music Pack for Radio NV - No Song Info Messages** and these will go away.

* **Where can I find Willow?**
* She can be found in an abandoned tent on the road South of Primm between the Nevada Highway Patrol Station and the Nipton Road Rest Stop.

* **Can I add or remove mods in this list?**
* **_NO. IF YOU CHANGE THIS LIST IN ANY WAY YOU VOID ALL SUPPORT._**
